# 2dConvolution
A demonstration of 2dConvolution visualized in Jupyter Notebooks using matplotlib and numpy.

I recommend making a virtual environment, then running:
- py -m pip install "numpy"
- py -m pip install "matplotlib".

These are the only two packages required in order for the code to run properly.

In the Notebook, I have marked certain sections as "Written by John Rieffel" because this was done as a project for one of his courses, and I wanted to make it clear which sections were completed solely by me.
